There was a prince. He was rich and handsome. Then he died. That was not all, he realized a phantasmic soul appeared out of his coffin. It was out to get revenge on all the mistresses 
that ruined his life.
He started to haunt his first ex who killed his cat. Unfortunately, this cat didn't follow him in the afterlife.
In a tragic turn of events, as the soul of his ex was taken by the death, he realized that indeed his beloved cat had possesed the body of his previous mistress, as cats are wont to do. This made sense to the prince, as she was a rather dull woman. 
He spoke with her as he wanted to declare how much he hated her and how he had his life ruined by her. However, the cat possessed mistress began to cry and revealed the truth to the prince. It was all a ploy by her father to destroy their relationship and twist his character. All the harm and pain that was done to him was in fact actions of the mistress's father! 
Finally, he killed her father and took his soul to the hell together.
